## 2. âœ… Approval Rules Configuration

### API Endpoints Created:

- `GET /api/admin/approval-rules` - List all rules
- `POST /api/admin/approval-rules` - Create rule
- `PATCH /api/admin/approval-rules/:id` - Update rule

### Advanced Logic:

```typescript
// Example: Large expense rule
{
  name: "Large Expense Approval",
  minAmount: 25000,
  maxAmount: null,
  isManagerApproverRequired: true,  // âœ… NEW FIELD
  approvers: [
    { userId: "finance-manager", order: 1 },
    { userId: "director", order: 2 },
    { userId: "ceo", order: 3 }
  ],
  isSequential: true,  // Must approve in order
  minApprovalPercentage: 100,
  specificApproverRule: {  // âœ… NEW FIELD
    enabled: true,
    approverId: "cfo"  // If CFO approves, auto-approve
  }
}
```

## 3. âœ… Expense Submission Workflow

### API Endpoints Created:

3. If rule has isManagerApproverRequired = true:
   - Add employee's manager as first approver (order 0)
4. Add rule approvers (order 1, 2, 3...)
5. If no rule found:
   - Default to manager approval only
6. Update expense status to "Submitted"
```

// Parallel Approval (60% rule)
3 approvers total
2 approve (66%) â†’ Approved

// Specific Approver Rule
CFO approves â†’ Instant auto-approval (bypasses others)
```

## 5. âœ… Multi-Currency Support

### API Endpoints Created:

- `GET /api/currency/convert?from=USD&to=INR&amount=100` - Convert currency

### Database Updates:

Added to Expense model:

- `currency` - Original expense currency
- `currencySymbol` - Original currency symbol
- `convertedAmount` - Amount in company currency
- `companyCurrency` - Company's base currency
- `exchangeRate` - Conversion rate used
- `conversionDate` - When conversion happened

### Features:

- âœ… Expense can be in different currency than company
- âœ… Auto-convert using Exchange Rate API
- âœ… Store both original and converted amounts
- âœ… Display: "$1,000 USD (â‰ˆ â‚¹83,000 INR)"
- âœ… Approval rules use converted amount
- âœ… Exchange rate stored for audit trail

### Currency Conversion Example:

```typescript
// Employee submits expense in USD
Expense: $1,000 USD

// Company currency is INR
// System fetches exchange rate: 1 USD = 83 INR
// Converts: $1,000 Ã— 83 = â‚¹83,000

// Stores:
{
  amount: 1000,
  currency: "USD",
  currencySymbol: "$",
  convertedAmount: 83000,
  companyCurrency: "INR",
  exchangeRate: 83.0,

npm install @google-cloud/vision
```

#### Option 2: Tesseract.js (Free, Client-side)

```bash
npm install tesseract.js
```

#### Implementation Steps:

1. Create `/api/ocr/scan-receipt` endpoint
2. Accept image upload
3. Send to OCR service
4. Parse response for:
   - Amount
   - Date
   - Vendor/Merchant
   - Category (guess from vendor)
